# @wixc3/engine-scripts

Tooling for building and running of applications written using the `@wixc3/engine-core` package.

## `engine create [feature-name]`

Generates a feature folder with all basic imports and declarations.

-   `feature-name` should be dash-separated
-   optional `featuresDir` argument for specifying the path to the features directory in the project .
-   optional `templatesDir` argument for having customized templates/folder structure

### `engine.config.js` options

-   `featuresDirectory` - same as `featuresDir` in CLI options
-   `featureTemplatesFolder` - same as `templatesDir` in CLI options
-   `featureFolderNameTemplate` - for overriding default feature folder name template (see [Templating options](#templating-options))

### Templating options

If you wish to work with your own templates directory, using the `templatesDir` option, you can use `${featureName}` in your customized templates whenever you want, including folder names.
Each file/folder name you want as a template should end with `.tmpl`, other extensions/folder names are ignored and get copied as they are.

#### Possible spacial casing for your templates:

-   camelCase: `${featureName.camelCase}`
-   dash-case: `${featureName.dashCase}`
-   PascalCase: `${featureName.pascalCase}`

For example, given the following templates folder:

-   feature
    -   \${featureName.dashCase}.feature.ts.tmpl = `export const ${featureName.camelCase} = ...`
-   test-\${featureName.dashCase}.tmpl
    -   \${featureName.dashCase}.spec.ts.tmpl = `describe('${featureName.pascalCase} feature', () => ...`
-   README.md = `Hi ${featureName.pascalCase}!`

If `featureName` is `cool-thing`, the parsed folder will be:

-   feature
    -   cool-thing.feature.ts = `export const coolThing = ...`
-   test-cool-thing
    -   cool-thing.spec.ts = `describe('CoolThing feature', () => ...`
-   README.md = `Hi ${featureName.pascalCase}!` (NOT PARSED, file doesn't end with `.tmpl`)
