# ${featureName.pascalCase} Feature

This folder contains a generated boilerplate for your new feature. Use it as an easy starting point for your development
flow.

### Working out of the box
* Feature demo - ready to start development, a runnable example for your browser.
* Mocha tests in browser - while developing, run and debug your tests in the comfort of your browser.

### Using the boilerplate
Currently, testing and demoing the new feature is done using separate commands (to be merged to one in the future)
inside your feature directory.

* Run `yarn start` - development flow, runs your example in the browser. Output is at
[`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
* Run `yarn test` - runs the tests in watch mode, keeping the browser open to debug. Found at
[`http://localhost:3001`](http://localhost:3001).

### Important files
These files come pre-configured so the boilerplate feature is runnable. Update them to suit your feature requirements.

* `.feature` - A feature declaration, requires updating dependencies.
* `.config` - A runnable example file for your feature.
* `.main.env` - Setup of your feature in `main` environment.
* `package.json` - Requires updating dependencies.
